# TradingCards

## Goals
I have a few goals for this personal project.
* Create a Trading Card game! (Think collectible cards like Baseball or Football cards)
* Actually FINISH a python project and be satisfied with it.
* Look at forks from my friends over at /r/learnpython to see what they are up to and how I can learn from what they do
* Learn how to better use github revision control for my future career

## Files
These are the files and what they do
### Trading Card Game Structure.txt
This was just a quick idea I came up with at work while it was slow, but it gave me something to base my code on.
### TradingCards.py
This is the main file. This has all the classes (Card, Pack, Theme) in it.
### create.py
This is where you go if you want to create a theme or pack.
###edit.py
This is where you go if you want to edit a theme or pack (in the future)
###pyrand.py
This is my own RNG. It's slower than the stdlib because... It's written in python!
### tests.py
This holds the tests for testing that all the stuff works correctly
